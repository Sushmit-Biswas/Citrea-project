### Voting Code Project on Citrea Testnet

## Overview
This project is a simple voting code written in Solidity, utilizing the Remix Ethereum IDE for compiling and deploying smart contracts. It leverages CBTC for transactions, ensuring a seamless voting experience.

## Features
- Simple Voting Mechanism: A straightforward voting system that allows users to cast votes.
- Solidity Implementation: Written in Solidity, the contract-oriented programming language for Ethereum.
- Remix Ethereum IDE: Compiled and deployed using the Remix Ethereum IDE.
- CBTC Transactions: Utilizes CBTC for secure and efficient transactions.

## Requirements
- Solidity Compiler: Version 0.8.19 or higher.
- Remix Ethereum IDE: For compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- CBTC (Citrea Bitcoin) and Citrea Testnet: For transaction execution.

## Setup and Deployment
1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open in Remix IDE: Open the project in Remix Ethereum IDE.
3. Compile the Contract: Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the Contract: Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network.
5. Configure CBTC: Set up CBTC for transaction execution.

## Usage
